- Signal system working (EventBus.enemy_killed fires with correct XP values)

### Test Reliability Note:
- Same quit timing issue as character tests (results print multiple times)
- **Action:** Fix quit logic in test script

### Recommendations:
1. Update test expected values to match actual game balance
