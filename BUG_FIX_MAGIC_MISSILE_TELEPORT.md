**Bug ID:** MAGIC-MISSILE-001
**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Date:** 2025-10-19

## üî¥ Problem Description

**User Report:**
> "For some reason whenever magic missle is selected or an upgrade to number missles the character seems to jump to the center of the map for some reason."

**Symptoms:**
- Player teleports to center of map (0, 0, 0) when Magic Missile is equipped
- Also happens when Magic Missile upgrades are applied (e.g., Multi-Missile upgrade)
- Does NOT happen with other weapons (BonkHammer, Spinning Blade)

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### The Issue:

1. **WeaponManager was a `Node`** (not `Node3D`)
   - `Node` has no transform/position properties
   - Child Node3D objects had broken transform hierarchy

2. **Weapons were setting `global_position` every frame**
   ```gdscript
   # OLD CODE (problematic):
   func _process(delta: float) -> void:
       if not player:
           return
       global_position = player.global_position + offset
   ```

3. **Transform Hierarchy Issue:**
   ```
   Player (CharacterBody3D) - has transform
     ‚îî‚îÄ WeaponManager (Node) - NO TRANSFORM ‚ùå
         ‚îî‚îÄ MagicMissile (Node3D) - tries to set global_position
   ```

4. **Why it only affected Magic Missile:**
   - Magic Missile is dynamically added when selected
   - BonkHammer is already in the scene at start (pre-existing)
   - Timing issue during weapon instantiation caused position glitch

## ‚úÖ The Fix

### Changed WeaponManager from `Node` to `Node3D`:

**File: `scenes/player/Player.tscn`**
```diff
- [node name="WeaponManager" type="Node" parent="."]
+ [node name="WeaponManager" type="Node3D" parent="."]
```

**File: `scripts/managers/WeaponManager.gd`**
```diff
- extends Node
+ extends Node3D
  class_name WeaponManager
```

### Changed weapons to use local position instead of global:

**File: `scripts/weapons/MagicMissile.gd`**
```diff
  func _process(delta: float) -> void:
-     """Keep weapon positioned near player"""
-     if not player:
-         return
-     var offset = Vector3(0.5, 1.0, 0.3)
-     global_position = player.global_position + offset
+     """Keep weapon positioned near player"""
+     # Position wand at a fixed local offset
+     # Since WeaponManager is now a Node3D child of Player, we can use local position
+     var offset = Vector3(0.5, 1.0, 0.3)
+     position = offset
```

**File: `scripts/weapons/BonkHammer.gd`**
```diff
      var offset = Vector3(
          cos(final_angle) * orbit_radius,
          0.0,
          sin(final_angle) * orbit_radius
      )
-     global_position = player.global_position + offset
+     # Set position relative to player (local position since WeaponManager is child of Player)
+     position = offset
```

## ‚ú® Benefits of This Fix

1. **Correct Transform Hierarchy:**
   ```
   Player (CharacterBody3D)
     ‚îî‚îÄ WeaponManager (Node3D) ‚úÖ Now has proper transform
         ‚îî‚îÄ MagicMissile (Node3D)
         ‚îî‚îÄ BonkHammer (Node3D)
   ```

2. **More Efficient:**
   - Setting `position` (local) is faster than `global_position`
   - No need to calculate player.global_position + offset every frame
   - Weapons automatically follow player through parent transform

3. **Cleaner Code:**
   - Removed unnecessary player reference in MagicMissile._process()
   - Weapons now properly use scene hierarchy
   - Less prone to timing/initialization issues

4. **Prevents Future Bugs:**
   - Any future weapons added will work correctly
   - No more transform hierarchy issues
   - Consistent behavior across all weapons

## üß™ Testing

### How to Test:

1. **Start a new game**
2. **Level up and select Magic Missile upgrade**
3. **Verify player does NOT teleport to center**
4. **Level up again and select Multi-Missile upgrade (increases projectile count)**
5. **Verify player does NOT teleport**

### Expected Behavior:
- ‚úÖ Player stays at current position when Magic Missile is equipped
- ‚úÖ Player stays at current position when Magic Missile is upgraded
- ‚úÖ Magic Missile appears at correct offset from player (0.5m right, 1.0m up, 0.3m forward)
- ‚úÖ Magic Missile follows player smoothly
- ‚úÖ BonkHammer continues to orbit correctly

---

## üìã Files Changed

1. `scenes/player/Player.tscn` - Changed WeaponManager from Node to Node3D
2. `scripts/managers/WeaponManager.gd` - Changed to extend Node3D
3. `scripts/weapons/MagicMissile.gd` - Use local position instead of global
4. `scripts/weapons/BonkHammer.gd` - Use local position instead of global

---

## üéØ Impact

**Severity:** HIGH (game-breaking bug)
**Frequency:** Every time Magic Missile is equipped
**User Impact:** Players could not use Magic Missile without teleporting

**Fix Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Tested:** Ready for user testing

## üìù Notes for Future Development

### Best Practice: Weapon Position Handling

When creating new weapons:

1. **Use local `position`, not `global_position`**
   ```gdscript
   # GOOD:
   position = Vector3(offset_x, offset_y, offset_z)

   # BAD:
   global_position = player.global_position + offset
   ```

2. **Trust the scene hierarchy**
   - WeaponManager is a child of Player
   - Weapons are children of WeaponManager
   - Local positions automatically inherit parent transforms

3. **Only use global_position when:**
   - Spawning independent objects (projectiles, effects)
   - Raycasting or distance checks
   - Not for position updates every frame!
