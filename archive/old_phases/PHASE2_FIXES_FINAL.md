# Phase 2 Final Bug Fixes

**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Status:** Both critical bugs FIXED ‚úÖ

---

## üéØ Issues Fixed

1. ‚úÖ **Bonk Hammer using range AOE instead of collision**
2. ‚úÖ **FastEnemy jittering movement**

---

## Bug #1: Bonk Hammer Collision System - FIXED

### The Problem

**Before (WRONG):**
- Bonk Hammer damaged ALL enemies within 3m radius every 1 second
- Created invisible "pulsing AOE aura" effect
- Enemies took damage even when hammer wasn't touching them
- Not visually accurate - felt like cheating

**Expected (Vampire Survivors style):**
- Hammer should ONLY damage enemies it physically collides with
- Collision-based, not range-based
- Visually accurate orbital weapon

### The Fix

**Changed to collision-based damage system:**

1. **Added weapon type system** (`BaseWeapon.gd`)
   - Weapons can be: "ranged", "orbital", or "aura"
   - BonkHammer set to "orbital"
   - Disables inherited auto-attack for orbital weapons

2. **Implemented collision detection** (`BonkHammer.gd`)
   - Connected to `AttackRange.body_entered` signal
   - Only damages enemies on physical collision
   - Added 0.5s hit cooldown per enemy (prevents multi-hits)
   - Tracks hit enemies with timestamp dictionary

3. **Reduced collision radius** (`BonkHammer.tscn`)
   - Changed from 3.0m to **0.5m** (tight collision matching hammer size)
   - Configured to detect enemies on collision layer 2

### How It Works Now

```
Hammer orbits ‚Üí Collides with enemy ‚Üí Check cooldown ‚Üí Deal damage ‚Üí Track hit time
```

**Key Features:**
- Visually accurate - only damages what it touches
- 0.5 second cooldown per enemy
- Automatic cleanup of old hit tracking
- Proper Vampire Survivors-style orbital weapon behavior

## Bug #2: FastEnemy Jittering - FIXED

### The Problem

**Before:**
- FastEnemy had `move_speed = 6.0` m/s
- NavigationAgent3D couldn't handle the high speed smoothly
- Enemies jittered back and forth, stuttered, didn't move properly
- BasicEnemy (3.0) and TankEnemy (1.5) worked fine

**Root Cause:**
6.0 m/s was too fast for Godot's navigation system to compute smooth paths.

### The Fix

**Reduced move_speed to a manageable level:**

In `FastEnemy.tscn`:
- Changed `move_speed` from **6.0** to **4.5**
- Changed `NavigationAgent3D.max_speed` to **4.5**

### Why 4.5?

**Speed Comparison:**
- TankEnemy: 1.5 m/s (baseline slow)
- BasicEnemy: 3.0 m/s (baseline normal)
- **FastEnemy: 4.5 m/s (50% faster than basic)**
- Old FastEnemy: 6.0 m/s (too fast)

**Benefits:**
- Still noticeably faster than BasicEnemy
- Within navigation system's smooth handling range
- Matches `acceleration = 10.0` setting
- Provides challenge without feeling broken

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Test #1: Bonk Hammer Collision

**Setup:**
1. Let 3-4 enemies approach you in a cluster
2. Watch the Bonk Hammer orbit

**Expected Behavior:**
- [ ] Hammer only damages enemies it visibly touches
- [ ] Enemies NOT touched by hammer don't take damage
- [ ] Console shows: "Bonk Hammer collided with enemy for 15 damage"
- [ ] Same enemy can't be hit twice within 0.5 seconds
- [ ] Hammer scales up briefly when hitting

**IMPORTANT:** The hammer should feel precise now - you should see the hammer physically touch an enemy before it takes damage.

---

### Test #2: FastEnemy Movement

**Setup:**
1. Survive to Wave 4 (90 seconds)
2. Observe yellow FastEnemy spawn and movement

**Expected Behavior:**
- [ ] Yellow enemies spawn (smaller capsules)
- [ ] Console shows: "Enemy spawned with 25.0 HP"
- [ ] FastEnemy move smoothly toward player (NO JITTERING!)
- [ ] FastEnemy visibly faster than red BasicEnemy
- [ ] FastEnemy die in 2 Bonk hits (25 HP √∑ 15 damage = 2 hits)

**Feel Test:**
FastEnemy should feel:
- Threatening (chases faster)
- Smooth (no stuttering)
- Fragile (dies quickly to compensate for speed)

---

### Test #3: Combined System Test

**Run a 5-minute session and verify:**

**Combat Flow:**
1. Enemies approach
2. Bonk Hammer orbits and hits enemies on collision
3. Enemies take damage only when touched
4. Enemies die and drop XP gems
5. XP gems collected and player levels up

**Enemy Variety:**
- [ ] Wave 1-3: Red BasicEnemy only (50 HP, 3.0 speed)
- [ ] Wave 4+: Mix of red BasicEnemy + yellow FastEnemy (25 HP, 4.5 speed)
- [ ] Both enemy types move smoothly
- [ ] FastEnemy noticeably faster than BasicEnemy

**Weapon Accuracy:**
- [ ] Hammer only damages what it touches
- [ ] No invisible AOE damage
- [ ] Visual feedback matches damage dealt

## üöÄ After Testing Passes

**If all tests pass:**

1. ‚úÖ Confirm Phase 2 is 100% complete
2. üì¶ Provide GitHub repository URL
3. üîº I'll push all code to GitHub
4. üéØ Begin Phase 3:
   - **HUD** (health bar, XP bar, level, timer)
   - **Upgrade Screen** (choose 3-4 random upgrades on level up)
   - **Additional Weapons** (2-3 new weapons)

## Expected Console Output

```
=== WAVE 4 STARTED ===
Wave 4 - Spawning enemy type: res://scenes/enemies/FastEnemy.tscn
Enemy spawned with 25.0 HP
Wave 4 - Spawning enemy type: res://scenes/enemies/BasicEnemy.tscn
Enemy spawned with 50.0 HP
Bonk Hammer collided with enemy for 15 damage
Enemy took 15.0 damage. HP: 35.0/50.0
Bonk Hammer collided with enemy for 15 damage
Enemy took 15.0 damage. HP: 10.0/25.0
[... 0.5 seconds pass ...]
Bonk Hammer collided with enemy for 15 damage
Enemy took 15.0 damage. HP: 20.0/50.0
```

**Key differences:**
- "Bonk Hammer collided" (not "attacked X enemies")
- Damage happens on collision, not every second to all in range
- Individual collision events, not batch AOE
