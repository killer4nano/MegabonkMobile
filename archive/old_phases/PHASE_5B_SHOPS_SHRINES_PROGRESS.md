## üîß System Architecture

### Gold Pickup Flow

```
Enemy dies
    ‚Üì
BaseEnemy.spawn_gold()
    ‚Üì
For each gold_value (1-3 coins):
    Instantiate GoldCoin
    Set random offset position
    Add to scene
    ‚Üì
GoldCoin._physics_process():
    Check distance to player
    If within magnet_range (5m):
        Fly toward player
    ‚Üì
GoldCoin collision with player
    ‚Üì
collect():
    GlobalData.current_gold += gold_value
    EventBus.gold_collected.emit(amount, total)
    queue_free()
    ‚Üì
HUD._on_gold_collected():
    Update gold_label.text
```

### Shrine Activation Flow

```
Player enters InteractionArea (2m radius)
    ‚Üì
BaseShrine._on_player_entered()
    player_in_range = true
    update_label() ‚Üí Show "[PRESS SPACE]"
    ‚Üì
Player presses SPACE
    ‚Üì
BaseShrine.attempt_activate():
    Check: is_active? ‚Üí Abort
    Check: GlobalData.current_gold >= cost?
        If NO ‚Üí Print error, abort
        If YES ‚Üí Continue
    ‚Üì
    Spend gold:
        GlobalData.current_gold -= cost
        EventBus.gold_collected.emit(0, total)
    ‚Üì
    Apply effect (override in subclass):
        HealthShrine: player.heal(max_health * 0.5)
        DamageShrine: player.apply_damage_buff(1.5)
        SpeedShrine: player.apply_speed_buff(1.3)
    ‚Üì
    Set is_active = true
    update_label() ‚Üí Show "[ACTIVE]"
    ‚Üì
    await buff_duration seconds
    ‚Üì
    Remove effect (override in subclass):
        DamageShrine: player.remove_damage_buff()
        SpeedShrine: player.remove_speed_buff()
    ‚Üì
    Set is_active = false
    update_label() ‚Üí Show cost again
