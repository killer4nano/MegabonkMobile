## üêõ Critical Bugs Found

### BUG #1: Enemy Type Variety Missing
**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** üî¥ Not Fixed

**Description:**
All enemies spawning as red capsules (BasicEnemy only). No yellow (FastEnemy) or purple (TankEnemy) variants visible.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Waves 1-3: Mostly BasicEnemy (red)
- Waves 4-7: Mix of BasicEnemy (red) and FastEnemy (yellow)
- Wave 8+: All three types (red, yellow, purple)

**Actual Behavior:**
Only red BasicEnemy spawning regardless of wave number.

**Root Cause (Confirmed via Console):**
All enemies show "50.0 HP" max health in console. FastEnemy should be 25 HP, TankEnemy should be 150 HP.
WaveManager.gd is spawning only BasicEnemy regardless of wave number.

**Fix Required:**
Investigate WaveManager.select_enemy_type_for_wave() and spawn_enemy() methods.

### BUG #2: Enemy Damage Visual Feedback Shared
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Status:** üî¥ Not Fixed

**Description:**
When one enemy takes damage, ALL enemies glow white simultaneously. Only the damaged enemy should flash.

**Expected Behavior:**
Individual enemy flashes white when hit by Bonk Hammer.

**Actual Behavior:**
All enemies flash together when any single enemy is damaged.

**Root Cause (Suspected):**
Enemies sharing the same material instance. Material changes affect all instances.

**Fix Required:**
Make material unique per enemy instance in BaseEnemy.gd _ready() function.

---

### BUG #3: Enemies Only Pathfind When Player Is Close
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Status:** üî¥ Not Fixed

**Description:**
Enemies spawn but stand idle until player approaches. Then they start chasing.

**Expected Behavior:**
Enemies should immediately start pathfinding toward player from spawn point.

**Actual Behavior:**
Enemies only activate pathfinding when player enters a certain range.

**Root Cause (Suspected):**
BaseEnemy.gd has a detection_range check that prevents pathfinding until player is close.

**Fix Required:**
Remove or increase detection_range, or make pathfinding always active.

---

### BUG #4: No Console Output for XP/Leveling
**Severity:** LOW (Visual/Debug Issue)
**Status:** üî¥ Not Fixed

**Description:**
No console messages showing XP collection or level up events.

**Expected Behavior:**
Console should show:
- "Collected X XP (total: Y/Z)"
- "‚≠ê LEVEL UP! Now level X ‚≠ê"
- Enemy spawn/death messages

**Actual Behavior:**
Console is silent or missing XP-related debug prints.

**Root Cause (Suspected):**
Debug print statements may have been removed or conditional on a debug flag.

**Fix Required:**
Re-add or uncomment debug print statements in PlayerController.gd and XPGem.gd.

## üîß Fix Plan

**Strategy:** Fix all bugs together in one batch, then test comprehensively.

**Delegation:**
- **Sub-Agent 1:** Fix BUG #1 (Enemy variety) and BUG #3 (Pathfinding)
- **Sub-Agent 2:** Fix BUG #2 (Visual feedback) and BUG #4 (Console output)

**Timeline:**
1. Deploy sub-agents to fix issues (15-20 minutes)
2. Consolidate fixes
3. User testing session (all fixes together)
4. If all pass: Mark Phase 2 complete ‚úÖ
5. Push to GitHub
