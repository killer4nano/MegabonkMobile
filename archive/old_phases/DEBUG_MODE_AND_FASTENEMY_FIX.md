# Debug Mode + FastEnemy Movement Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Status:** Both features implemented ✅

---

## ✅ Feature #1: DEBUG/TESTING MODE

Perfect for testing without dying!

### What It Does

1. **God Mode (Infinite HP)** - You cannot die
2. **1-Hit Kill** - Bonk Hammer instantly kills all enemies

### How to Use

**Debug mode is ACTIVE by default.** Just load the game and play!

**To toggle ON/OFF:**

Open these files and change `DEBUG_MODE`:

**M:\GameProject\megabonk-mobile\scripts\player\PlayerController.gd** (lines 9-11):
```gdscript
const DEBUG_MODE: bool = true   # Set to false to disable
const DEBUG_GOD_MODE: bool = true
const DEBUG_ONE_HIT_KILL: bool = true
```

**M:\GameProject\megabonk-mobile\scripts\weapons\BonkHammer.gd** (lines 9-10):
```gdscript
const DEBUG_MODE: bool = true
const DEBUG_ONE_HIT_KILL: bool = true
```

### Console Output

When active, you'll see:
```
========================================
⚠️  DEBUG MODE ACTIVE ⚠️
  ✓ God Mode: ON (invincible)
  ✓ 1-Hit Kill: ON (instant kill)
========================================
```

When taking damage:
```
[DEBUG] God mode active - ignoring 10 damage
```

When hitting enemies:
```
[DEBUG] 1-hit kill mode active - damage set to 9999
Bonk Hammer collided with enemy for 9999 damage
```

## ✅ Feature #2: FastEnemy Smooth Movement

Completely reworked FastEnemy movement to eliminate jittering.

### The Fix

**FastEnemy now uses direct movement** instead of NavigationAgent3D:
- Simple beeline chase toward player
- No pathfinding overhead
- No waypoint corrections
- Butter-smooth at 4.5 speed

### How It Works

**Speed-Based Movement System:**
- **Fast enemies (speed >= 4.0):** Use direct movement
- **Normal/Tank enemies (speed < 4.0):** Use NavigationAgent3D pathfinding

**FastEnemy behavior:**
1. Calculate direction: `enemy_pos → player_pos`
2. Set velocity directly toward player
3. Smooth acceleration with lerp
4. Rotate to face player
5. Move smoothly, no jittering!

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test Debug Mode

1. **Start the game**
2. **Check console** - Should see "DEBUG MODE ACTIVE" banner
3. **Let enemies hit you** - You won't die
4. **Hit enemies with hammer** - They die instantly (9999 damage)
5. **Survive Wave 4** - You should easily reach yellow FastEnemy spawn

**Expected:**
- ✅ Enemies cannot kill you
- ✅ You 1-shot all enemies
- ✅ Can test for as long as needed

---

### Test FastEnemy Movement

1. **Survive to Wave 4** (90 seconds)
2. **Look for yellow capsules** (smaller, FastEnemy)
3. **Watch their movement**

**Expected:**
- ✅ Yellow FastEnemy spawn
- ✅ They move smoothly toward you (NO JITTERING!)
- ✅ They beeline straight to you (direct chase)
- ✅ Faster than red BasicEnemy
- ✅ Die instantly from hammer (debug mode)

**Key Test:** Do yellow enemies move smoothly without stuttering?

## 📊 Complete Testing Checklist

Run through these tests:

### Debug Mode:
- [ ] Console shows "DEBUG MODE ACTIVE" on game start
- [ ] Enemies cannot kill you (infinite HP)
- [ ] Bonk Hammer 1-shots all enemies
- [ ] Can survive indefinitely for testing

### FastEnemy Movement:
- [ ] Yellow FastEnemy spawn at Wave 4
- [ ] Console: "Enemy spawned with 25.0 HP"
- [ ] FastEnemy move smoothly (no jittering!)
- [ ] FastEnemy beeline toward player
- [ ] Visibly faster than red BasicEnemy
- [ ] Still collide with player and attack

### Bonk Hammer (from previous fix):
- [ ] Hammer only hits enemies it touches
- [ ] No invisible AOE damage
- [ ] Console: "Bonk Hammer collided with enemy"

## 🎯 After Testing

**If FastEnemy moves smoothly:**
- ✅ Phase 2 is 100% COMPLETE!
- 📦 Ready to push to GitHub
- 🚀 Begin Phase 3 (HUD, Upgrades, or More Weapons)

**If FastEnemy still jitters:**
- Report the behavior
- I'll try an even more aggressive fix (disable NavigationAgent3D entirely)

## How to Disable Debug Mode (For Production)

When ready to disable debug features:

1. Open `PlayerController.gd`

## Expected Gameplay with Debug Mode ON

- You can explore all waves without dying
- Test enemy behavior freely
- FastEnemy spawn at Wave 4 with smooth movement
- TankEnemy spawn at Wave 8 (purple, 150 HP)
- All enemies die in 1 hit from hammer
- Perfect for testing and debugging!
