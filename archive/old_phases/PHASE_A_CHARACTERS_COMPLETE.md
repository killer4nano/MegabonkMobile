## ✨ Passive Ability Implementation

### 1. Damage Reduction (Tank)

```gdscript
# In PlayerController.take_damage():
var reduced_amount = amount * (1.0 - damage_reduction_percent)
current_health -= reduced_amount
```

### 2. Melee/Ranged Damage Bonuses (Warrior, Ranger)

```gdscript
# Stored in player, weapons will read these values
player.melee_damage_multiplier  # 1.2 for Warrior (+20%)
player.ranged_damage_multiplier  # 1.3 for Ranger (+30%)

# Future: Weapons check these multipliers when dealing damage
```

### 3. XP Multiplier (Mage)

```gdscript
# In PlayerController.collect_xp():
var modified_amount = amount * xp_multiplier  # 1.15 for Mage (+15%)
current_xp += modified_amount
```

### 4. Critical Bonuses (Assassin)

```gdscript
# In PlayerController.apply_character_data():
crit_chance += data.crit_chance_bonus  # 0.05 → 0.30 (5% → 30%)
crit_multiplier += data.crit_damage_bonus  # 2.0 → 2.5 (200% → 250%)
```

### 5. Extra Starting Weapons (Mage)

```gdscript
# In GameManager.apply_character_to_player():
if character_data.extra_starting_weapons > 0:
    var extra_weapons = ["fireball", "ground_slam"]
    for i in range(extra_starting_weapons):
        weapon_manager.equip_weapon(extra_weapons[i])
```

### 6. Pickup Range Bonus (Ranger)

```gdscript
# In CharacterData (ranger.tres):
pickup_range = 5.0  # vs default 3.0

# Applied in PlayerController.apply_character_data():
pickup_range = data.pickup_range
```

## 🐛 Known Issues / Edge Cases

### Handled:
- ✅ Missing character data file → Falls back to warrior
- ✅ No character selected → Defaults to warrior
- ✅ Insufficient Essence → UNLOCK button disabled
- ✅ Already unlocked character → Shows SELECT button
- ✅ Already selected character → Shows "SELECTED" (disabled button)
- ✅ Save corruption → Warrior is always unlocked by default

### To Monitor:
- ⚠️ Weapon damage multipliers not yet implemented in weapons (passives stored but weapons don't read them yet)
- ⚠️ Critical hit system not yet implemented in weapons
- ⚠️ Character color might not persist if player material is overridden elsewhere

---

## 📈 Balance Notes

**Early Testing Observations Needed:**
- Is Tank too tanky? (150 HP + 15% reduction = ~176 effective HP)
- Is Assassin too fragile? (60 HP with no defensive bonuses)
- Is Mage's 3-weapon start too strong?
- Do unlock costs feel fair? (500, 750, 1000, 1500 Essence)
- How many runs to unlock all characters?

**Suggested Balance Adjustments (if needed):**
- Increase/decrease unlock costs based on playtest feedback
- Adjust Tank HP to 130 if too strong
- Adjust Assassin HP to 70 if too weak
- Adjust passive bonuses (e.g., Warrior +15% instead of +20%)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (User Testing):
1. Open Godot project
2. Run Main Menu scene
3. Click PLAY → Character Select
4. Test all characters
5. Report any bugs or balance issues

### Short Term (After Testing):
- Fix any bugs found
- Tune character stats based on feedback
- Implement weapon damage multipliers for Warrior/Ranger passives
- Implement critical hit system for Assassin

### Phase D (Shops & Shrines):
- Gold-based shops during runs
- Temporary buff shrines
- Health restoration shrines
- Reroll shop for upgrades
