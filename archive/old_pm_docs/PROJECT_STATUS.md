## üìû HANDOFF NOTES FOR FUTURE AGENTS

**If you're taking over this project:**

1. **Read these files first:**
   - This file (PROJECT_STATUS.md)
   - CLAUDE.md (technical architecture)
   - GameDevelopmentPlan.txt (original vision)

2. **Run the automated tests:**
   ```bash
   cd M:\GameProject\megabonk-mobile
   "M:\Godot_v4.5.1-stable_mono_win64\Godot_v4.5.1-stable_mono_win64.exe" --headless --path . res://scenes/testing/ShrineSystemTest.tscn
   ```

3. **Check current phase:**
   - Look at "NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS" section above
   - Follow priority order

4. **Use sub-agents:**
   - Don't try to do everything yourself
   - Delegate specialized tasks
   - Create tests first, then features

5. **Document everything:**
   - Update this file after major milestones
   - Create test documentation
   - Write completion summaries
