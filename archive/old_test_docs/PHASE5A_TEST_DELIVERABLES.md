## Important Notes

### Differences from Original Task Specification

The actual character implementation differs from the task description. Tests were built based on the **actual codebase**, not the task spec:

**Task vs. Actual:**

| Character | Task Passive | Actual Passive |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Warrior | 20% damage reduction | +20% melee damage |
| Ranger | +20% XP gain | +30% ranged damage + pickup range |
| Tank | +50% max HP | 150 HP (fixed) + 15% damage reduction |
| Assassin | +15% move speed | +25% crit chance + 50% crit dmg |
| Mage | -10% weapon cooldown | +15% XP + 2 starting weapons |

**Unlock Costs:**
- Task: 100, 200, 300, 400 Essence
- Actual: 500, 750, 1000, 1500 Essence

### GlobalData Integration
- Uses `GlobalData.current_character` (not `selected_character`)
- Character IDs are lowercase: "warrior", "ranger", "tank", "assassin", "mage"
- Unlock system uses `GlobalData.unlocked_characters` array

### Character Resource Paths
All characters loaded from: `res://resources/characters/{id}.tres`

Example:
```gdscript
var warrior = load("res://resources/characters/warrior.tres")
var ranger = load("res://resources/characters/ranger.tres")
```
