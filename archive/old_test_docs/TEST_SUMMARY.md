## Total: 61 Test Assertions

## Test Features

### Automated Execution
- Runs completely headless (no user input required)
- Uses phase-based timing system
- Waits for physics frames for collision detection
- Automatic test progression

### Comprehensive Logging
- Each test logs [PASS] or [FAIL] with descriptive message
- Final summary shows:
  - Total tests run
  - Passed count
  - Failed count
  - Success rate percentage
  - List of failed tests (if any)

### Collision Detection
- Uses `await get_tree().physics_frame` for collision updates
- Positions enemies in weapon paths
- Waits up to 5 seconds for collisions
- Tracks damage changes to verify hits

### Weapon Type Coverage
- **Orbital weapons:** Bonk Hammer, Spinning Blade (collision-based damage)
- **Ranged weapons:** Magic Missile (projectile-based damage)
- Tests all weapon stats: damage, speed, range, cooldown

## Expected Test Results

### Expected Pass Rate: ~90-95%

**Tests likely to pass:**
- All spawn tests (weapons equip correctly)
- All stat verification tests (damage, speed, radius values)
- Weapon manager tests
- Upgrade calculation tests
- Weapon type verification tests

**Tests that may need adjustment:**
- Orbital motion detection (timing-sensitive)
- Collision damage tests (physics-dependent, may need longer wait times)
- Hit cooldown tests (timing-sensitive)
- Projectile homing tests (pathfinding-dependent)

**Known potential issues:**
1. **Collision timing:** Physics collisions may take longer than expected in some runs
2. **Enemy positioning:** Enemies may move before collision occurs (AI behavior)
3. **Projectile tracking:** Homing may fail if enemy dies or despawns
4. **Frame timing:** Some tests rely on specific frame counts for motion detection

## Running the Tests

### In Godot Editor:
1. Open Godot 4.5+
2. Load the project: `M:\GameProject\megabonk-mobile\project.godot`
3. Open the scene: `scenes/testing/WeaponSystemTest.tscn`
4. Press F6 to run the current scene
5. Watch the console output for test results
6. Test will auto-quit after completion

### Expected Console Output:
```

## Test Maintenance

### To add new tests:
1. Add a new TestPhase to the enum
2. Create a test function following the naming pattern `test_weapon_feature()`
3. Add the phase to the `_process()` match statement
4. Use `log_pass()` and `log_fail()` for assertions

### To modify timing:
- Adjust `phase_timer` thresholds in `_process()` match cases
- Increase wait times in collision tests if needed
- Modify `await get_tree().create_timer(X).timeout` values

### To add new weapons:
1. Add spawn test for new weapon
2. Add behavior tests specific to weapon type
3. Add damage/cooldown tests
4. Follow existing test patterns

## Notes for Test Engineer

1. **Physics-dependent tests:** Tests involving collision may occasionally fail due to timing
2. **Enemy AI:** Enemies have pathfinding enabled; they may move during tests
3. **Weapon registration:** WeaponManager auto-registers weapons added as children
4. **Projectile lifecycle:** Projectiles despawn on hit or after 5s lifetime
5. **Debug mode:** Tests run with standard weapon damage (not god mode)

## Success Criteria

- **Minimum 85% pass rate:** Indicates core weapon system is functional
- **All spawn tests pass:** Weapons must equip correctly
- **All stat tests pass:** Weapon values must match specifications
- **At least 75% damage tests pass:** Some collision timing variance is acceptable

## Integration

These tests integrate with:
- EventBus (weapon_equipped signal)
- WeaponManager (weapon registration and management)
- BaseWeapon (auto-attack system)
- BaseEnemy (damage system and groups)
- Navigation system (enemy positioning)

## Future Enhancements

1. Add tests for weapon combos
2. Add tests for multiple weapons equipped simultaneously
3. Add tests for weapon removal
4. Add performance tests (FPS impact with many weapons)
5. Add edge case tests (null targets, dead enemies, etc.)
6. Add visual regression tests (particle effects, animations)
