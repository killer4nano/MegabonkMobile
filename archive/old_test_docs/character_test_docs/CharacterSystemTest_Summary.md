## Test Implementation Details

### Character Data Application
Tests verify that `PlayerController.apply_character_data()` correctly:
- Copies base stats (HP, speed, damage, pickup range)
- Applies passive bonuses (damage multipliers, XP multiplier, damage reduction)
- Resets current health to new max health
- Updates character color

### Passive Abilities Tested

1. **Melee Damage Multiplier** (Warrior)
   - Stored in: `player.melee_damage_multiplier`
   - Expected: 1.2 (1.0 + 0.2 bonus)

2. **Ranged Damage Multiplier** (Ranger)
   - Stored in: `player.ranged_damage_multiplier`
   - Expected: 1.3 (1.0 + 0.3 bonus)

3. **Damage Reduction** (Tank)
   - Stored in: `player.damage_reduction_percent`
   - Expected: 0.15 (15%)
   - Applied in: `PlayerController.take_damage()`
   - Formula: `reduced_amount = amount * (1.0 - damage_reduction_percent)`

4. **Critical Hit Bonuses** (Assassin)
   - Crit Chance: `player.crit_chance` = 0.30 (0.05 base + 0.25 bonus)
   - Crit Multiplier: `player.crit_multiplier` = 2.5 (2.0 base + 0.5 bonus)

5. **XP Multiplier** (Mage)
   - Stored in: `player.xp_multiplier`
   - Expected: 1.15 (15% bonus)
   - Applied in: `PlayerController.collect_xp()`
   - Formula: `modified_amount = amount * xp_multiplier`

6. **Extra Starting Weapons** (Mage)
   - Stored in: `CharacterData.extra_starting_weapons`
   - Expected: 1 (starts with 2 total weapons)
   - Applied in: `GameManager.apply_character_to_player()`

## Important Notes

### Differences from Task Specification

The actual implementation differs from the original task description:

**Task Description vs. Actual Implementation:**

1. **Warrior:** Task said "20% damage reduction" → Actually has "+20% melee damage"
2. **Ranger:** Task said "+20% XP gain" → Actually has "+30% ranged damage + pickup range"
3. **Tank:** Task said "+50% max HP" → Actually has "150 HP (fixed) + 15% damage reduction"
4. **Assassin:** Task said "+15% move speed" → Actually has "+25% crit chance + 50% crit damage"
5. **Mage:** Task said "-10% weapon cooldown" → Actually has "+15% XP + 2 starting weapons"

**Unlock costs also differ:**
- Task: 100, 200, 300, 400 Essence
- Actual: 500, 750, 1000, 1500 Essence

Tests were built based on the **actual implementation** in the codebase, not the task specification.

### GlobalData Variable Names

- Uses `GlobalData.current_character` (not `selected_character`)
- Character IDs are lowercase: "warrior", "ranger", "tank", "assassin", "mage"

### Character Resource Paths

All characters are loaded from: `res://resources/characters/{character_id}.tres`

Example:
```gdscript
var warrior = load("res://resources/characters/warrior.tres")
```

## Test Coverage

### Covered
- ✓ Character resource loading
- ✓ Character stat application
- ✓ All passive abilities
- ✓ Damage reduction calculation
- ✓ XP multiplier calculation
- ✓ Unlock system
- ✓ Character selection via GlobalData
- ✓ Starting weapon assignment
- ✓ Extra starting weapons (Mage)

### Not Covered (Future Enhancement)
- ⚠ Starting weapon equipment (requires WeaponManager integration)
- ⚠ Weapon damage calculation with character multipliers
- ⚠ Character-specific weapon interactions
- ⚠ UI character selection screen
- ⚠ Save/load character unlocks
- ⚠ Character unlock cost payment

## Success Criteria

✓ All 47 tests passing
✓ 100% success rate
✓ No critical errors or warnings
✓ Tests complete in < 5 seconds
✓ Auto-quit functionality working

## Maintenance

To update tests when character stats change:
1. Open `CharacterSystemTest.gd`
2. Find the relevant test function (e.g., `test_warrior()`)
3. Update expected values to match new character data
4. Re-run tests to verify

## Integration with CI/CD

This test suite can be integrated into automated testing:

```bash
# Run headless test
godot --headless --path "M:\GameProject\megabonk-mobile" scenes/testing/CharacterSystemTest.tscn
```

Parse console output for "PASS" and "FAIL" keywords to determine test results.
