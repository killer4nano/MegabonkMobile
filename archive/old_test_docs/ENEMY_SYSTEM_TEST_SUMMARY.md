- **Wave 10 (8+ range):** 50% Basic, 30% Fast, 20% Tank

✅ **Difficulty Scaling:**
- Spawn interval decreases with wave number
- Minimum spawn interval enforced (1.0s)
- Spawn positions randomized around arena perimeter (~20m radius)

## Test Execution Flow

The test suite uses a **phase-based execution system** to ensure proper timing and cleanup:

```
SETUP → Enemy Spawning → BasicEnemy → FastEnemy → TankEnemy
     → Enemy AI → Enemy Combat → Enemy Death → Wave Manager → COMPLETE
```

Each phase:
1. Waits 0.5s for scene stabilization
2. Executes all tests in that category
3. Cleans up spawned enemies
4. Advances to next phase

---

1. Open Godot 4.5+
2. Load project: `M:\GameProject\megabonk-mobile\project.godot`
3. Open scene: `scenes/testing/EnemySystemTest.tscn`
4. Press **F6** (Run Current Scene)
5. Watch console output for test results

### Method 2: Command Line
```bash

## Important Notes

### 1. **DEBUG_MODE Consideration**
The combat tests (TEST 6) will gracefully skip if `DEBUG_MODE = true` in `PlayerController.gd`. The tests detect this by checking if damage is actually applied to the player.

To enable full combat testing:
- Set `DEBUG_MODE = false` in `scripts/player/PlayerController.gd` (line 9)

### 2. **Physics Timing**
The tests use proper physics frame synchronization:
```gdscript
await get_tree().physics_frame
await get_tree().create_timer(1.0).timeout
```

This ensures collision detection and movement are properly evaluated.

### 3. **Enemy Cleanup**
All spawned enemies are properly cleaned up with `queue_free()` after each test to prevent interference between test phases.

### 4. **NavigationRegion3D Required**
The test scene includes a NavigationRegion3D for proper pathfinding tests. Without this, BasicEnemy and TankEnemy AI tests may fail.

### 5. **Signal Testing**
The tests verify EventBus signals are properly emitted:
- `EventBus.enemy_spawned` (on spawn)
- `EventBus.enemy_killed` (on death)

## Key Design Patterns Validated

### 1. **Speed-Based Movement Selection**
- Enemies with speed >= 4.0 use direct movement (FastEnemy)
- Enemies with speed < 4.0 use NavigationAgent3D (BasicEnemy, TankEnemy)
- Prevents jittering at high speeds

### 2. **Group-Based Entity Detection**
- All enemies added to "enemies" group on spawn
- Enables weapon systems to target enemies efficiently

### 3. **Signal-Based Event Communication**
- EventBus.enemy_spawned on spawn
- EventBus.enemy_killed on death
- Decouples enemy system from other game systems

### 4. **Resource-Based Stat Design**
- Stats defined per enemy type (HP, speed, damage, gold, XP)
- Allows designer-friendly balance tweaking

### 5. **Automatic Loot Spawning**
- XP gems spawn at death position (+0.5m Y offset)
- Gold coins spawn with slight randomization for visual variety
- No external dependencies required

---

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Fail to Run
- Ensure Godot 4.5+ is installed
- Verify all enemy scenes exist in `scenes/enemies/`
- Check NavigationRegion3D is present in test scene

### Combat Tests Always Skip
- This is expected if DEBUG_MODE is enabled
- Disable DEBUG_MODE in PlayerController.gd for full combat testing

### AI Tests Fail (Enemies Not Moving)
- Verify NavigationRegion3D is configured
- Check player is in "player" group
- Ensure enemies spawn on NavMesh surface (Y=0)

### Wave Manager Tests Fail
- Verify WaveManager.gd is at `scripts/managers/WaveManager.gd`
- Check WaveManager node is in test scene
- Ensure all methods exist (select_enemy_type_for_wave, etc.)

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions to the test suite:

1. **Performance Tests**
   - Spawn 100+ enemies and measure FPS
   - Validate object pooling (if implemented)

2. **Stress Tests**
   - Test enemy pathfinding with obstacles
   - Test multiple enemies targeting same player

3. **Edge Case Tests**
   - Enemy spawning when player is dead
   - Enemy behavior when player teleports far away

4. **Integration Tests**
   - Test enemy + weapon interaction
   - Test enemy + extraction zone interaction

---

## Conclusion

This comprehensive test suite validates all core enemy system functionality with **60+ automated tests** covering:
- ✅ Enemy spawning and initialization
- ✅ Stat correctness for all 3 enemy types
- ✅ AI pathfinding and movement (both NavigationAgent3D and direct)
- ✅ Combat damage dealing
- ✅ Death mechanics and loot drops
- ✅ Wave manager spawning and difficulty scaling

The test suite is designed to run automatically, provide clear pass/fail output, and gracefully handle edge cases like DEBUG_MODE. All tests complete in approximately **10-15 seconds**.

**Test Success Criteria:** All 60+ tests passing = Enemy system is production-ready for Phase 2.
