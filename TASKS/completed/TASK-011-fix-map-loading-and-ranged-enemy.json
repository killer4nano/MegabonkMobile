      "severity": "HIGH - Visible gameplay bug"

    "issue": "Hardcoded to TestArena instead of ProceduralArena",
    "why_it_happened": "When procedural generation was added, this line was never updated",
    "fix": "Change to ProceduralArena.tscn to load procedural maps"
  },

  "bug_2_analysis": {
    "file": "RangedEnemy.gd",
    "lines": "95-101",
    "broken_behavior": "Used NavigationAgent3D pathfinding while trying to stop at exact 8m range",
    "issue": "NavigationAgent3D tries to complete path while enemy tries to stop, causing jitter",
    "why_it_happened": "RangedEnemy inherited navigation-based movement from BaseEnemy, but needs precise distance control",

      "file": "megabonk-mobile/scripts/enemies/RangedEnemy.gd",
      "lines": "100-114",
      "change": "Replaced NavigationAgent3D pathfinding with direct movement",
      "removed": "path_update_timer, update_target_position(), handle_movement(delta)",
      "added": "Direct vector calculation toward player, manual velocity/rotation control",
      "code": "var direction = global_position.direction_to(target_player.global_position)\nvelocity = velocity.lerp(direction * move_speed, acceleration * delta)\nrotation.y = lerp_angle(rotation.y, atan2(direction.x, direction.z), rotation_speed * delta)",
      "result": "Smooth movement toward player until 8m range, then smooth stop"
    }
  },

  "technical_details": {
    "why_navigation_caused_jitter": {
      "explanation": "NavigationAgent3D continuously recalculates path to reach target_position (player). When enemy gets within 8m range and tries to stop, nav agent says 'path not finished, keep moving' while velocity lerps to zero. This creates push-pull jitter.",
      "navigation_behavior": "is_navigation_finished() returns false when close to player, causing continuous velocity adjustments",
      "distance_control_conflict": "Enemy wants to stop at exactly 8m, but nav agent wants to reach player at 0m",
      "solution": "Bypass navigation entirely - use direct vector math for distance-based behavior"
    },
    "why_direct_movement_works": {
      "explanation": "Direct movement calculates direction vector toward player and applies velocity directly. No pathfinding, no navigation state. Enemy has full control over when to stop (distance check) and when to move (simple if/else).",
      "benefits": [
        "No navigation path conflicts",
        "Precise distance control",
        "Smooth acceleration/deceleration",
        "No jittering at stop distance"
      ]
    }

  "verification_steps": {
    "test_1_procedural_map": "Launch game → character select → play → verify ProceduralArena loads (different colors/layouts each run)",
    "test_2_ranged_enemy": "Play game → observe green ranged enemies → verify smooth movement toward player → verify smooth stop at range → verify shooting behavior",
    "expected_behavior": "ProceduralArena loads with unique layout. RangedEnemy walks smoothly toward player, stops at 8m, charges orange sphere, fires projectile."

    "lesson_1": "Feature integration requires updating ALL entry points (character select screen)",
