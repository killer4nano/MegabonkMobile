    "root_cause": "Upgrade system was only updating weapon instance variables (weapon.damage) but not the underlying weapon_data.base_damage. When BaseWeapon.upgrade() or load_weapon_data() was called, it would reload from weapon_data and overwrite the multiplied values, causing upgrades to be lost.",

    "testing_notes": "Manual code review confirms fix addresses root cause. Upgrades now persist in weapon_data resource, preventing loss on reload. Stacking should work correctly as each upgrade multiplies the persisted value."
