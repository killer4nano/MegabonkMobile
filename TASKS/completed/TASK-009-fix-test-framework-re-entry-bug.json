  "description": "Discovered and fixed a critical bug in the test framework where await calls inside _process() caused tests to run multiple times simultaneously, leading to inflated failure counts and unreliable test results.",

  "root_cause_analysis": {
    "symptom": "Test count growing from 208 → 293 → 318 across runs, indicating tests running multiple times",
    "discovery": "Code analysis revealed await calls inside _process() function that is called every frame (~60 FPS)",
    "mechanism": "When phase_timer > 0.5, test function is called with await. But _process() continues to be called every frame. Since await pauses execution and returns immediately, the next frame ALSO satisfies phase_timer > 0.5 (hasn't reached reset line yet), triggering the same test again. This creates multiple simultaneous test executions.",
    "impact": "Tests running 30-50 times instead of once, causing race conditions, inflated failure counts, and unreliable results",
    "severity": "CRITICAL - Completely invalidates test suite reliability"
  },

    "why_it_breaks": "Frame 1: phase_timer=0.6, calls await, pauses. Frame 2 (~16ms later): phase_timer=0.616, STILL > 0.5, calls await AGAIN. Frame 3: phase_timer=0.632, calls await THIRD TIME. This continues for ~30-50 frames before first test completes.",
    "the_fix": "TestPhase.TEST_WEAPON_MANAGER:\n    if phase_timer > 0.5:\n        current_phase = TestPhase.SETUP  # RESET IMMEDIATELY (prevents re-entry)\n        phase_timer = 0.0\n        await test_weapon_manager()  # Now safe to await\n        current_phase = TestPhase.NEXT  # Set final phase after test completes"
