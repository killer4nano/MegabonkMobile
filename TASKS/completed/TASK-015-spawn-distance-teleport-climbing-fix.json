  "description": "Three issues from user feedback after TASK-014: 1) Enemies spawn too far on large maps (at perimeter ~300-500m away), 2) No teleport system when player runs far from enemies, 3) Climbing still doesn't work (need to reduce obstacle heights, not just increase climb param).",

  "bugs_fixed": {
    "issue_1_spawn_too_far": {
      "problem": "Enemies spawning at perimeter of 600-1000 unit maps (300-500m from player)",
      "user_feedback": "enemies spawn too far away now on the map the spawns should happen somewhere close by the player i would say maybe 15m radius",
      "root_cause": "spawn_radius calculated as (arena_size / 2.0) - 3.0 = 297-497m",

      "impact": "Enemies path around obstacles instead of over them",
      "solution": "Reduce obstacle heights to 1.0-2.5 units, set agent_max_climb to 3.0 so navigation mesh can path over them"
