# Game Speed Fix Explanation

## The Problem
After removing debug code, the game speed needed proper calibration:

1. The game had `Engine.time_scale = 4.0` in PlayerController.gd (likely debug code)
2. When removed for cleanup, the game felt too slow at 1x speed
3. Setting it back to 4x made timing and controls difficult
4. Players couldn't click accurately at 4x speed

## The Solution
**The game runs best at 2x speed for mobile gameplay!**

We added `BASE_GAME_SPEED = 2.0` to DebugConfig.gd which:
- Sets the game to run at 2x speed by default
- Provides fast-paced mobile action without timing issues
- Allows accurate player input and responsive controls

## Technical Details

In `scripts/autoload/DebugConfig.gd`:
```gdscript
# Fast-paced mobile gameplay without timing issues
const BASE_GAME_SPEED: float = 2.0

func _ready():
    Engine.time_scale = BASE_GAME_SPEED
```

## Why 2x Speed?
- The game is a fast-paced mobile roguelite
- Quick gameplay sessions are essential for mobile
- Provides responsive action without timing difficulties
- Balances speed with accurate player control

## Debug Speed Control
If you need to slow down for debugging:
1. Enable DEBUG_MODE in DebugConfig.gd
2. Set GAME_SPEED_DEBUG_MULTIPLIER to 0.5 (for 1x actual speed)
3. Or set it to 1.5 (for 3x actual speed) for faster testing

## Bottom Line
**2x speed provides the optimal balance for MegabonkMobile - fast action with accurate controls.**
