# Game Speed Fix Explanation

## The Problem
After removing debug code, the game became 4x slower than normal. This happened because:

1. The game had `Engine.time_scale = 4.0` in PlayerController.gd
2. All gameplay was balanced and tested at 4x speed
3. When we removed this line for "cleanup", the game went to 1x speed
4. Everything felt sluggish and too slow

## The Solution
**The 4x speed IS the normal speed for this game!**

We added `BASE_GAME_SPEED = 4.0` to DebugConfig.gd which:
- Sets the game to run at 4x speed by default
- This is NOT a debug feature - it's the intended game speed
- All movement, animations, and timings were designed for this speed

## Technical Details

In `scripts/autoload/DebugConfig.gd`:
```gdscript
# This is the NORMAL speed the game was balanced for
const BASE_GAME_SPEED: float = 4.0

func _ready():
    Engine.time_scale = BASE_GAME_SPEED
```

## Why 4x Speed?
- The game is a fast-paced mobile roguelite
- Quick gameplay sessions are essential for mobile
- All enemy speeds, player movement, and combat were tuned at 4x
- Changing to "normal" 1x speed would require rebalancing everything

## Debug Speed Control
If you need to slow down for debugging:
1. Enable DEBUG_MODE in DebugConfig.gd
2. Set GAME_SPEED_DEBUG_MULTIPLIER to 0.25 (for 1x actual speed)
3. Or set it to 0.5 (for 2x actual speed)

## Bottom Line
**4x speed is not "fast" - it's the normal, intended speed for MegabonkMobile.**
