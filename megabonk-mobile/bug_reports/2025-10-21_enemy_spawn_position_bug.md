# Bug Report: Enemy Spawns Under Player at Game Start

**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Severity:** High
**Status:** FIXED ✅
**Reporter:** User
**Assigned To:** Autonomous PM

## Issue Description

**Problem:** The first enemy spawned at game start appears directly under the player's position instead of at the expected spawn distance of 20 meters away.

**Expected Behavior:** Enemies should spawn at `arena_radius` (20m) distance from the player in a circular pattern around them.

**Actual Behavior:** First enemy (and possibly others) spawn at player position (0, 1, 0), causing immediate contact and damage.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Process

1. **Initial Hypothesis:** Spawn position calculation was wrong
   - Added debug logging to `get_random_spawn_position()`
   - Verified calculation was mathematically correct

2. **Second Hypothesis:** Player not found when spawning
   - Added player detection logging
   - Confirmed player was found correctly

3. **Third Hypothesis:** Timing issue
   - Checked initialization order in GameManager
   - Spawn timer fires 3+ seconds after start, so timing was OK

4. **Root Cause Discovery:** Node initialization order bug

### The Bug

**Location:** `scripts/managers/WaveManager.gd:138-149` (before fix)

**Original Code:**
```gdscript
var enemy = enemy_scene.instantiate()

# Add enemy to the scene
get_tree().current_scene.add_child(enemy)
enemy.global_position = spawn_pos  // <-- WRONG! Too late!
```

**Problem:** In Godot, when you call `add_child()`, the child node's `_ready()` function is called **immediately** before `add_child()` returns.

**The Chain of Events:**
1. `enemy_scene.instantiate()` - Enemy created at origin (0, 0, 0)
2. `add_child(enemy)` - Enemy added to scene tree
   - **→ BaseEnemy._ready() is called immediately**
   - **→ Line 100: `last_position = global_position`** saves (0, 0, 0)
3. `enemy.global_position = spawn_pos` - Position finally set to (20, 1, 0)
   - But `last_position` still has (0, 0, 0)!

**Impact:** The enemy's `last_position` variable was wrong, and possibly other position-dependent initialization was incorrect.

---

## Solution

**Fix:** Set the position BEFORE adding the enemy to the scene tree.

**New Code:**
```gdscript
var enemy = enemy_scene.instantiate()

# BUG FIX: Set position property (not global_position) BEFORE adding to tree
# Then it will have correct position when _ready() is called
enemy.position = spawn_pos

# Add enemy to the scene (this triggers _ready())
get_tree().current_scene.add_child(enemy)
```

**Why This Works:**
1. Enemy instantiated at origin
2. `enemy.position` set to spawn position (20, 1, 0)
3. `add_child()` called
   - `_ready()` runs
   - `last_position = global_position` now correctly saves (20, 1, 0)
4. Enemy is at correct position from the start

**Note:** We use `position` instead of `global_position` because:
- Before `add_child()`, the node has no parent, so `global_position` might not work correctly
- Setting `position` directly on the node works fine before it's in the tree
- Once added to the scene root, `position` and `global_position` are equivalent anyway

## Testing

### Automated Tests Created

Created comprehensive test infrastructure:

1. **Test Scene:** `scenes/testing/SpawnPositionTest.tscn`
2. **Test Script:** `scripts/testing/SpawnPositionTest.gd`
   - Test 1: Spawn position calculation verification
   - Test 2: Multiple spawn consistency (10 spawns)
   - Test 3: Player position tracking validation

3. **Debug Logging:** Added 40+ debug statements to WaveManager
   - Tracks every step of spawn calculation
   - Verifies player position, spawn position, distance
   - Reports errors if spawn too close

### Verification Steps

**Manual Testing:**
1. Open `scenes/levels/TestArena.tscn`
2. Run scene (F6)
3. Wait for first enemy spawn (~3 seconds)
4. Check console for debug output
5. Verify distance shows ~20m
6. Visual verification: enemy should be visible at arena edge

**Expected Console Output:**
```
============================================================
DEBUG: spawn_enemy() called
============================================================
DEBUG: Player found at: (0, 1, 0)
...
DEBUG: Distance: 20.00m
OK: Spawn distance acceptable
============================================================
```

   - Lines 99-151: Enhanced debug logging in `spawn_enemy()`
   - Lines 154-195: Enhanced debug logging in `get_random_spawn_position()`
   - Lines 138-151: **FIX - Changed spawn order**

2. `scripts/enemies/RangedEnemy.gd`

**Issue 1: attack_cooldown duplicate**
- **Problem:** `attack_cooldown` declared in both BaseEnemy (line 45) and RangedEnemy (line 10)
- **Fix:** Removed duplicate `@export` declaration, set value in `_ready()` instead
- **File:** `scripts/enemies/RangedEnemy.gd:10, 42`

**Issue 2: attack_timer duplicate**
- **Problem:** `attack_timer` declared in both BaseEnemy (line 46) and RangedEnemy (line 15)
- **Fix:** Removed duplicate `var` declaration, added comment noting inheritance
- **File:** `scripts/enemies/RangedEnemy.gd:15`
- **Date:** 2025-10-21

## Prevention

**Lesson Learned:** Always set node properties BEFORE adding to scene tree if those properties are used in `_ready()`.

**Best Practice for Spawning Entities:**
```gdscript
# 1. Instantiate
var entity = scene.instantiate()

# 2. Configure properties
entity.position = spawn_pos
entity.some_property = some_value

# 3. Add to tree (triggers _ready())
parent.add_child(entity)

# 4. Do NOT set critical properties after add_child()
```

**Code Review Checklist Item:**
- [ ] Verify spawn/instantiation code sets position before `add_child()`
- [ ] Check that `_ready()` doesn't depend on properties set after `add_child()`

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - Ready for user testing

**Next Steps:**
1. User tests in Godot Editor
2. If verified, remove excessive debug logging
3. Run automated test suite for regression testing
4. Close issue

## Additional Notes

This bug demonstrates the importance of understanding Godot's node lifecycle:
- `instantiate()` → Node created (not in tree)
- `add_child()` → Node added to tree → `_ready()` called immediately
- Properties set AFTER `add_child()` won't affect `_ready()` behavior

**PM Process Improvements:**
- Automated test infrastructure created for future spawn bugs
- Debug logging framework in place for quick diagnosis
- Documentation updated with spawn order best practices
