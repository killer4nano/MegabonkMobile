# Quick Start: Procedural Arena Testing

## How to Run the Procedural Map Generator

### Option 1: Run in Godot Editor (Recommended for Testing)

1. **Open Godot 4.5+**
   ```
   Open: M:\GameProject\megabonk-mobile\project.godot
   ```

2. **Open ProceduralArena Scene**
   ```
   Navigate to: res://scenes/maps/ProceduralArena.tscn
   ```

3. **Run the Scene**
   ```
   Press: F6 (or click "Play Scene" button)
   ```

4. **Observe Console Output**
   Look for generation logs:
   ```
   === PROCEDURAL MAP GENERATION STARTED ===
   Arena size: 52 x 52
   Color theme: ice
   Floor created: 52 x 52
   Boundary walls created
   Obstacles placed: 15 / 15 requested
   Navigation mesh created and baked
   Enemy spawn zones calculated: 8 zones
   === VALIDATING PATHFINDING ===
   Pathfinding validation: 8 / 8 spawn zones reachable
   Pathfinding validation PASSED
   === PROCEDURAL MAP GENERATION COMPLETE ===
   ```

5. **Play the Game**
   - Use WASD to move (keyboard)
   - Use virtual joystick (on-screen, bottom-left)
   - Enemies spawn from random zones around perimeter
   - Each restart generates a NEW map!

### Option 2: Compare with Static Arena

**Test Static Arena (Original):**
```
Open: res://scenes/levels/TestArena.tscn
Press: F6
```
- This arena is ALWAYS THE SAME
- Good for testing baseline gameplay

**Test Procedural Arena:**
```
Open: res://scenes/maps/ProceduralArena.tscn
Press: F6
```
- This arena is DIFFERENT EVERY TIME
- Restart multiple times to see variety

## What to Look For

### Visual Indicators

‚úÖ **Different Floor Colors Each Run**
- Desert: Tan/orange floor
- Ice: Light blue floor
- Lava: Dark red floor
- Forest: Green floor

‚úÖ **Random Obstacle Placement**
- Pillars (cylinders)
- Boxes/walls (rectangles)
- Rocks (spheres)
- Different positions each run

‚úÖ **Various Arena Sizes**
- Small: ~40x40m
- Medium: ~50x50m
- Large: ~60x60m

### Console Output Checklist

‚úÖ "ProceduralMapGenerator: Using random seed"
‚úÖ "Arena size: X x X" (40-60 range)
‚úÖ "Color theme: [desert/ice/lava/forest]"
‚úÖ "Obstacles placed: X / Y" (should match)
‚úÖ "Pathfinding validation: 8 / 8 spawn zones reachable"
‚úÖ "WaveManager: Found ProceduralMapGenerator"

### Gameplay Verification

‚úÖ Player spawns in center (clear area)
‚úÖ Enemies spawn from perimeter
‚úÖ Enemies can navigate around obstacles
‚úÖ Weapons hit enemies
‚úÖ XP gems drop and collect
‚úÖ Game runs smoothly (60 FPS)

## Testing Different Configurations

### Test Maximum Complexity

1. Open ProceduralArena.tscn
2. Select ProceduralMapGenerator node
3. In Inspector, set:
   - `arena_size_max = 60`
   - `obstacle_count_max = 20`
4. Run scene (F6)
5. Check performance - should still be smooth

### Test Minimum Complexity

1. Select ProceduralMapGenerator node
2. In Inspector, set:
   - `arena_size_min = 40`
   - `arena_size_max = 40`
   - `obstacle_count_min = 8`
   - `obstacle_count_max = 8`
3. Run scene (F6)
4. Map will always be 40x40 with exactly 8 obstacles

### Test Reproducible Maps (Seeds)

1. Select ProceduralMapGenerator node
2. In Inspector, set:
   - `use_seed = true`
   - `generation_seed = 12345`
3. Run scene (F6)
4. Note the exact layout
5. Restart scene
6. Layout should be IDENTICAL
7. Change `generation_seed` to different number
8. Layout should be DIFFERENT

### Test Color Theme Variety

Run the scene 10 times and track themes:
- Run 1: desert
- Run 2: ice
- Run 3: forest
- Run 4: lava
- Run 5: ice (can repeat)
- ... etc.

Should see all 4 themes appear multiple times.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Map looks the same every time

**Check:**
- Is `use_seed` set to `true`? ‚Üí Set to `false` for random
- Are min/max values the same? ‚Üí Increase range for variety

### Issue: Enemies not spawning

**Check Console for:**
- "WaveManager: Found ProceduralMapGenerator" ‚úÖ
  - If NOT found ‚Üí Check node name and script path
- "WaveManager: No ProceduralMapGenerator found" ‚ùå
  - Means using fallback circular spawn (still works)

### Issue: "Obstacles placed: 10 / 15"

**Meaning:**
- Requested 15 obstacles, only placed 10
- Not enough space to place all obstacles
- **This is OK** - map still playable

**Fix (if needed):**
- Increase `arena_size_max`
- Decrease `obstacle_count_max`
- Decrease `min_obstacle_spacing`

### Issue: "Pathfinding validation FAILED"

**Meaning:**
- Some spawn zones unreachable from center
- Rare but can happen with dense obstacle placement
- **Map still playable** - just a warning

**Fix (if needed):**
- Restart scene for new generation
- Decrease `obstacle_count_max`
- Increase `min_obstacle_spacing`

## Performance Benchmarks

**Expected Frame Times:**
- Generation: <100ms (one-time at startup)
- Gameplay: <16ms (60 FPS during play)

**Check Performance:**
1. Run ProceduralArena.tscn
2. Click Debug ‚Üí Show Monitors
3. Check FPS counter
4. Should be 60 FPS or higher

**On Low-End Devices:**
- Reduce `obstacle_count_max` to 12
- Reduce `arena_size_max` to 50
- Should improve performance

## Integration Testing

### Test Full Game Loop

1. Open ProceduralArena.tscn
2. Run scene (F6)
3. Play until level 2 (collect XP)
4. Verify upgrade screen appears
5. Choose upgrade
6. Continue playing
7. Verify all systems work:
   - ‚úÖ Player movement
   - ‚úÖ Weapon attacks
   - ‚úÖ Enemy pathfinding
   - ‚úÖ XP collection
   - ‚úÖ Leveling system
   - ‚úÖ Upgrade screen
   - ‚úÖ Wave progression

### Test Extraction System (if implemented)

1. Run ProceduralArena.tscn
2. Wait 3 minutes (extraction zone spawns)
3. Navigate to extraction zone
4. Stand in zone for 5 seconds
5. Verify extraction succeeds
6. Check ExtractionSuccessScreen shows stats

## Customization Examples

### Create a "Nightmare Mode" Map

```gdscript
# In ProceduralMapGenerator node Inspector:
arena_size_min = 40
arena_size_max = 45  # Smaller arena
obstacle_count_min = 18
obstacle_count_max = 20  # Many obstacles
min_obstacle_spacing = 1.5  # Tighter spacing
center_clearance_radius = 3.0  # Less safe space
```

Result: Cramped, challenging arena with lots of obstacles

### Create a "Wide Open" Map

```gdscript
# In ProceduralMapGenerator node Inspector:
arena_size_min = 55
arena_size_max = 60  # Larger arena
obstacle_count_min = 8
obstacle_count_max = 10  # Few obstacles
min_obstacle_spacing = 4.0  # Wide spacing
center_clearance_radius = 8.0  # Lots of safe space
```

Result: Open, spacious arena with room to maneuver

### Create a "Ice Level" Only Map

```gdscript
# In ProceduralMapGenerator.gd, modify _select_color_theme():
func _select_color_theme() -> void:
    current_theme = color_themes["ice"]  # Force ice theme
    print("Color theme: ice (forced)")
```

Result: Every run uses ice theme colors

## Next Steps After Testing

Once you verify procedural generation works:

1. **Set as Main Scene (Optional):**
   - Project ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Run
   - Set Main Scene: `res://scenes/maps/ProceduralArena.tscn`

2. **Update MainMenu (if exists):**
   - Point "Start Game" to ProceduralArena instead of TestArena

3. **Export to Mobile:**
   - Test generation time on real device
   - Verify performance acceptable
   - Adjust obstacle counts if needed

4. **Share with Testers:**
   - Get feedback on variety
   - Check if maps feel balanced
   - Collect favorite seeds
