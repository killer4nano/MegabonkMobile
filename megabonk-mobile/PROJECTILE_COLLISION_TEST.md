# RangedEnemy Projectile Collision Test

## Bug Description
Rangers were not shooting visible projectiles that could be dodged. Two issues discovered:

### Bug #1: Projectiles passed through player (FIXED)
Projectiles spawned and flew but didn't collide with player.

### Bug #2: Instant damage on range entry (FIXED)
Player took damage immediately when entering 8m range, before projectile fired.

## Root Causes

### Bug #1: Collision Layer Mismatch
**Problem:** EnemyProjectile had `collision_mask = 1` (detects Layer 1) but Player is on Layer 3 (`collision_layer = 4`).

**Result:** Projectiles spawned and moved but passed through player without collision detection.

**Fix Applied:**
- `collision_layer = 4` (Layer 3 - enemy projectile)
- `collision_mask = 4` (detects Layer 3 - player) ‚úÖ FIXED

**Files modified:**
- `scripts/enemies/EnemyProjectile.gd:19`
- `scenes/enemies/EnemyProjectile.tscn:19-20`

### Bug #2: Instant Contact Damage
**Problem:** BaseEnemy.gd automatically calls `attack_player()` when player enters AttackRange. For RangedEnemy (8m range), this caused instant contact damage before projectile fired.

**Result:** Player took 10 damage immediately when entering 8m range, defeating the purpose of dodgeable projectiles.

**Fix Applied:**
RangedEnemy now overrides:
- `_on_attack_range_entered()` - Does NOT call attack_player()
- `attack_player()` - Empty method (no contact damage)

**Files modified:**
- `scripts/enemies/RangedEnemy.gd:235-252`

## Automated Test

### Test Coverage
The automated test (`RangedEnemyProjectileTest.tscn`) verifies:

1. ‚úÖ **Collision Layer Configuration**
   - Validates projectile has correct `collision_layer = 4`
   - Validates projectile has correct `collision_mask = 4`

2. ‚úÖ **No Instant Damage on Range Entry** (NEW)
   - Creates RangedEnemy within 8m of player
   - Waits 1.5 seconds for range detection
   - Verifies player takes NO damage from contact
   - Ensures only projectiles can damage player

3. ‚úÖ **Projectile Spawning**
   - Creates RangedEnemy near test player
   - Waits for enemy to charge (0.8s telegraph)
   - Verifies projectile is spawned after charge completes

4. ‚úÖ **Projectile Collision Detection**
   - Monitors player health
   - Verifies NO damage before projectile hits
   - Confirms projectile deals damage on collision
   - Validates proper collision detection

### Running the Automated Test

#### Option 1: Batch File (Headless)
```bash
cd M:\GameProject\megabonk-mobile\scripts\testing
run_projectile_test.bat
```

**Note:** You may need to edit the batch file to set your Godot installation path.

#### Option 2: Godot Editor
1. Open Godot and load the project
2. Open scene: `res://scenes/testing/RangedEnemyProjectileTest.tscn`
3. Press **F6** (Run Current Scene)
4. Check the Output console for test results

#### Option 3: Command Line
```bash
godot --headless --path "M:\GameProject\megabonk-mobile" res://scenes/testing/RangedEnemyProjectileTest.tscn
```

## Manual Testing Guide

If you prefer to verify manually:

1. **Launch the game**
   - Open `TestArena.tscn`
   - Press F6 to run

2. **Wait for RangedEnemies to spawn**
   - Green capsule enemies with 8m attack range
   - They stay back and shoot from distance

3. **Observe the attack sequence:**
   - ‚úÖ Orange/yellow charge indicator appears (0.8s telegraph)
   - ‚úÖ Green glowing projectile fires toward player
   - ‚úÖ Projectile travels at 7.0 m/s (dodgeable)
   - ‚úÖ Projectile hits player and deals 8 damage
   - ‚úÖ Player health decreases

4. **Test dodging:**
   - Move perpendicular to projectile path
   - Projectile should miss and despawn after 5 seconds

## Technical Details

### Collision Layer Setup
| Entity | Collision Layer | Collision Mask | Purpose |
|--------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| Player | 4 (Layer 3) | 3 (Layers 1+2) | Character body |
| Enemy | 2 (Layer 2) | 5 (Layers 1+3) | Enemy body |
| EnemyProjectile | 4 (Layer 3) | 4 (Layer 3) | Hits player ‚úÖ |
| PlayerProjectile | 16 (Layer 5) | 2 (Layer 2) | Hits enemies |

### RangedEnemy Attack Flow
1. **Detection:** Player enters 8m range
2. **Line of Sight:** Raycast check (prevents shooting through walls)
3. **Charge Telegraph:** 0.8s with orange sphere indicator
4. **Fire Projectile:** Spawns at enemy position + (0, 1.5, 0)
5. **Travel:** Projectile moves at 7.0 m/s toward player
6. **Collision:** Area3D detects player and calls `take_damage(8.0)`
7. **Cooldown:** 2.0s before next shot

### Projectile Properties
- **Speed:** 7.0 m/s (reduced from 10.0 for dodgeability)
- **Damage:** 8.0
- **Lifetime:** 5 seconds (auto-despawn)
- **Visual:** Green glowing sphere (0.2m radius)
- **Collision:** 0.2m radius sphere

## Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ All 4 automated tests pass
- ‚úÖ Projectiles are visible in-game
- ‚úÖ Projectiles can be dodged by moving
- ‚úÖ Projectiles deal 8 damage on contact
- ‚úÖ NO instant damage when entering range
- ‚úÖ NO instant damage when charge completes
- ‚úÖ Only projectile collision deals damage

## Fixes Summary

### Before:
1. ‚ùå Projectiles passed through player (wrong collision mask)
2. ‚ùå Instant 10 damage when entering 8m range (auto attack_player call)
3. ‚ùå Projectiles visible but non-functional

### After:
1. ‚úÖ Projectiles detect and collide with player (correct collision mask)
2. ‚úÖ No instant damage - only projectiles damage player
3. ‚úÖ Fully functional dodgeable projectile system
4. ‚úÖ 0.8s charge telegraph before firing
5. ‚úÖ 7.0 m/s projectile speed (balanced for dodging)

## Status
**READY FOR USER TESTING** - Both bugs fixed, automated tests updated to catch both issues.
